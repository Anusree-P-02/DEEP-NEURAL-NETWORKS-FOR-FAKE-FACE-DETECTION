This project implements a CNN-based Fake Face Detection System to identify manipulated facial images created using deepfake technology. By analyzing features like texture
anomalies, lighting inconsistencies, and pixel-level distortions, the system classifies images as "Real" or "Fake" with high accuracy. It employs preprocessing techniques
like resizing and normalization, along with CNN layers such as Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dense, to extract and analyze features efficiently. Designed for real-time detection,
it aims to combat privacy threats, misinformation, and security risks. Future enhancements include extending detection to videos, multi-class classification, API integration,
and cloud deployment for scalability.
